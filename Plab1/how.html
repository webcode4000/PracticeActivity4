    <span class="highlight">Foul Shots</span>, also called <span class="highlight">"free throws,"</span> 
    are used in basketball to penalize players for committing fouls, especially while making shots for points. 
    When a player is fouled while trying to score, they are awarded <span class="highlight">free throws</span> as a way 
    of compensating for the unfair advantage gained by the fouling player.

            <p>Foul shots are crucial in basketball for several reasons:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Promotes Fair Play:</strong> By penalizing fouls, the foul shot helps players stick to the rules and 
                promotes fair play.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Increases Scoring Opportunities:</strong> Free throws provide teams with additional chances to score points,
                which can be critical in close games.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Strategic Element:</strong> Coaches often develop strategies around free throw shooting, including 
                deciding when to foul intentionally to stop the clock or to put poor free throw shooters on the line. 
                This may not seem ethical, but it has been seen consistently among collegiate and professional teams.
